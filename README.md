# Light-Weight-Multi-threaded-HTTP-Server
## About Project/Motivation for project
I opted for this project because I have been practicing front –end development from quite some time and i enjoys every bit of it,i want to build a carrier in web-development and i would be handy if i know how thins actually work behing those server, how a client receives signals and how to connect the project with database
So I researched about web designing and technologies related to it and found many good websites offering some very good courses since I was a beginner and wanted to make a responsive website, I tried almost all of them and then begin my journey to make a Light weight multi-threaded HTTP server using java.

## Beginning with the course
### 1.1.1 Multithreaded HTTP Server 
A server having more than one thread is known as Multithreaded Server. When a client sends the request, a thread is generated through which a user can communicate with the server. We need to generate multiple threads to accept multiple requests from multiple clients at the same time. 

### 1.1.2 HTML
 I started off with learning HTML, HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and block quotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn't have the ability to create dynamic functionality.
HTML helps us in making the basic skeleton of any website we can watch on the internet. Learning HTML was a lot easier as we have covered this language earlier in class 8th itself.

### 1.1.3 CSS
Then we had to design what we have made so far, Now CSS helps us make modification to the designing part . i started off with making the navigation bar and the did applied some custom backgrounds ,changed the font designing ,added margins and padding and also provided the webpage with some basic animations. Then i applied containers indicating what all features are provided in the website and added the item tray which shows the thumbnail of all the books available in the library. There is also a application form in which we can fill out our personal details and get registered and I finished it with designing a copyright footer

### 1.1.4 PHP
PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". PHP is a server-side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites .
Building an e-library deal with lot of data administration and storage which is facilitated through the use of PHP language.


## Requirement of Project

### Hardware Requirement
In the hardware part there was no such high-end requirement we just need to have a pc/laptop(any pc would do) which have a stable internet connection and can run basic software programs at ease.
### Software Requirement
For the software part i personally used VSCode with a live server extension added to it(you must add all the required environment such as jdk ), i also used XAMPP server for connecting to my database and this was pretty much everything i used. One can also use Notepad to serve the purpose.

## Modules of Project
### Connection with the server –
Opening of the connection with a server request of port number 8080(you can take any after making a little modification in code)
### Establishing connection with the server –
Search for http://localhost:8080/ in your chrome browser.
### Display of HTML and CSS file—
after searching client will sent a request to add html and css file it will open an close(oldest process will terminate itself)
### Multithreading—
you can add multiple process on the same time as they keep on terminating making space for new module to enter. Also you can access the same webpage multiple time by typing the http link on the browser and the process will run simuntanously in both of them
### Database— 
whatever data is typer in the logib must be stored in the datbase

## 3.1 Connection with the port





## 3.2 Logging in the HTTP server






## 3.3 Different attributes(display of html and css)




## 3.4 Login page






## 3.5 Error





## 3.6 Database
